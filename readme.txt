Customize and insert Commission Junction links using a simple shortcode.

== Description ==

This plugin allows you to customize and insert text links from the Commission Junction affiliate program into a post or page using a simple shortcode. This prevents the WordPress WYSIWYG editor from messing up the links and simplifies your HTML code. Inserting the shortcode [cj] with the parameters below will output the proper link HTML code in your published post or page.

== Installation ==

1. Download the latest zip file and extract the 'cj-link-shortcode' directory.
2. Upload it to your '/wp-content/plugins/' directory.
3. Activate 'Commission Junction Link Shortcode' on the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
4. Insert `[cj url="link-url" img="tracking-img-url"]Example link[/cj]` in your post or page (replacing your link's information).

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I use the shortcode? =

Simply type `[cj url="link-url" img="tracking-img-url"]Example link[/cj]` into your post. Replace `link-url`, `tracking-img-url`, and `Example link` with your Commission Junction link's information.

The relevant urls are contained within the HTML code of any of the Commission Junction links you are instructed to copy and paste.
